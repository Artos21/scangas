# scangas
Gas contamination sensor with transmission to the server. Arduino Uno project.
The software and hardware complex "SCANGAS" is designed for the timely detection of dangerous gases in the air and signaling about it:
  ⦁ detection of molecules of dangerous gases in the air;
  ⦁ alarm when the threshold value of the content of dangerous gases is exceeded;
  ⦁ data transfer to the remote monitoring system server.
